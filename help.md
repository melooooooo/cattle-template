Controls & UI:
The gameplay is split into two phases: selecting your target and the extraction procedure.
Town Map: You're presented with a neighborhood map. Hover your cursor over a house to scout the occupant, revealing their Age (Child, Teen, Adult, Elder) and, more importantly, their Traits. These traits are your key to planning a successful heist.
Extraction Interface:
Lucidity Bar (Yellow): This tracks how close the person is to waking up. If it maxes out, they wake up, and you fail. This is your primary meter to watch.
Pain Bar (Red): Measures the donor's pain level. If this fills, they can die from shock, resulting in failure.
Fear Bar (Purple): Tracks the target's fear. High fear will cause the Lucidity bar to fill faster.
Tool Tray (Bottom): Your arsenal for the delicate work ahead.
Your Objective:
The ultimate goal is to collect all 16 unique teeth to complete your "My Perfect Lovelies" collection. While common teeth (like Adult or Baby teeth) are plentiful, the rarest specimens must be taken from donors with very specific traits.
Item Introduction (Your Toolkit):
You have five essential tools at your disposal:
Fairy Dust: A sprinkle of colorful, magical sparkles. Function: Click to apply it to the mouth area. It effectively lowers the target's Lucidity and Fear. This is your main crowd-control tool.
Hook: Used to pry open the sleeper's mouth to begin the extraction. Function: The first step of any procedure. Causes a minor increase in Pain and Lucidity.
Anesthetic Syringe: Your go-to pain management solution. Function: A click will administer a dose, lowering the Pain bar and giving you more time for painful procedures like drilling.
Dental Drill: Used to loosen the tooth from its socket. Function: The most critical—and riskiest—part of the job. It rapidly increases all three meters, especially Pain and Lucidity.
Forceps: Used to pull out a tooth once it's fully loosened. Function: The final step to claim your prize.
2. Advanced Skills: Pro-Fae Tips
Handling Different Homeowners (Trait Strategies):
A Fae is only as good as their plan. Adapt your strategy based on the donor's traits.
Heavy Sleeper: Beginner's Best Friend. Their Lucidity meter fills very slowly. Feel free to be more aggressive with the drill. This is the perfect target for practice.
Tough: The Challenge Begins. These donors have stubborn teeth that require prolonged drilling, sending Pain and Lucidity skyrocketing. You'll need to frequently use both Fairy Dust and the Anesthetic.
Night Owl / Insomniac: High-Alert Targets. They start with a higher base Lucidity, which also fills much faster. You must be patient. Use the drill in very short bursts, followed immediately by Fairy Dust to keep them calm.
Fragile / Brittle: The teeth of these individuals are prone to shattering, leaving you with a "Worthless Cracked Tooth." Apply pressure gently and aim for the shortest possible drilling time.
Vampire / Ancient / Eldritch: Rare Loot Carriers. These special targets live in unique dwellings (castles, voids). They have unique mechanics; for example, the Vampire has almost no fear but wakes up incredibly fast. You must act decisively.
Strategic Anesthetic Use:
Don't just jab them whenever. Use the Anesthetic wisely.
Against "Tough" Targets: Since you'll be drilling for a while, Pain will be a major issue. Use the Anesthetic when the Pain bar hits the 70-80% mark. This creates a safe window to finish the job.
For Multi-Tooth Runs: If you're feeling greedy and want to extract multiple teeth from one person, use the Anesthetic when the cumulative pain gets high to reset the timer on a potential shock death.
When to Save It: You typically don't need it for simple extractions like Decayed or Baby Teeth, or on Heavy Sleepers. Fairy Dust is usually sufficient for these.
The Golden Rule: The rhythm of the game is "Drill a bit, dust a bit." Never get greedy. Prioritize keeping the Lucidity bar down, as a waking donor is the most common way to fail.
3. All Secrets and Endings: The Perfect Collection
### The Ending
The "ending" of The Tooth Fae is achieving 100% completion of your tooth collection. Once you've acquired all 16 unique teeth, your collection is complete. There is no final cutscene; the "My Perfect Lovelies" collection screen filled with your trophies is the ultimate reward.
